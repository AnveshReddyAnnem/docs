## Why Docker?

Because Containers are the largest shift in infrastructure which we will eventually have to take part in. Containers are the Fastest growing cloud enabling technology. Docker can cover entire lifecycle of the software management. They help in developing,building,testing,deploying,updating and recovery faster. Containers reduces complexity, they are consistent across the board regardless of operating system. Docker helps in reducing the maintance.

Like any other shift in infrastructure this may reduce many traditional practices,but opens doors to practices like Container App Development, Orchestration Management, Runtime management, Provisioning which might actually be cosidered traditional practices in a few years.
