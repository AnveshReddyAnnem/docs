#Base64
In order to prevent data corruption during transmission between different storage media, Base64 is the most commonly used binary-to-text algorithm used to convert data to plain text. Moreover, it is also used in text documents such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or XML to embed binary data. Base64 is well known due to the algorithm's high popularity, is endorsed by different programming languages, has made many updates, and of course, has its own specification.

By Engineers in late 80's Seven-bit, six-bit, and even three-bit bytes have been used. "Many systems used old encodings by the time the eight-bit encoding was approved as a standard and did not support the new standard". This led to the fact that during the transfer between the new and the old systems, some data was simply lost. For instance, when sending emails, a mail server may discard the eighth bit. In addition, mail servers had another problem: they could only send text, but not binary data (such as images, videos, archives). So to solve these problems, engineers created algorithms. Other binary-to-text encodings were of course, developed over time, but Base64 became the most popular and was used almost everywhere thanks to simplicity, efficiency and portability.
